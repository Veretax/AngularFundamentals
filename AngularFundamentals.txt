Learn about:
	Architecture (and how to bootstrap applciations)
	Angular Components
	Reusable Services (dependency injection)
	Forms and Validation
	API calls
	Unit Test
	Package Everything together

	TypeScript Overview

		Superset of JavaScript (additional features available for use)
		Uses transpilation.
		Syntactic Sugar
		You end up with valid JS (Dev syntactic sugar)

		Static Typing
			let variableName: string

		Interfaces
			interace ICat {
				name: string
				age?:number 
			}

			let fluffly:ICat

		Class Properties

			class Cat {
				name: string
				color: string
				constructor (name) {
					this.name = name
				}
			}

		Accessibility Levels: Public/Properties

			class Cat {
				name: string
				color: string
				constructor (name) {
					this.name = name
				}

				speak() { console.log('meow') }
			}

			let fluffy = new Cat()
			console.log(fluffy.name)
			fluffy.speak

			If you prefix the method and property with privgate the above code would give you a compile time error

			simplified constructor can look like:

			class Cat {
				constructor(private name, private color ) {
				}
			}

			let fluffy = new Cat('Fluffy', 'White');

Getting Started with Angular
	

			AngularJS (1.x)
				
				a View (template) referes to a controller which would expose models or objects

				a directive could create custom html elements to encapsulate display and functionality
			Angular (2+)

				a component has a template, models that represent your data.


	to install angular from commandline:
		npm install -g @angular/cli@11.2

		browse to src folder and create a project like this:
			ng new ng-fundamentals
				(where ng-fundamentals is the project name)

		It failed to fully install for me so I looked at this SO article:


	To create a new component
		1. Add a folder under app
		2. Create the component template file something like events-list.component.ts

			import { Component } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  selector: 'events-list',
  template: `
      <div>
        <h1>Upcoming Angular Events</h1>
      </div>
      
    `
})
export class EventsListComponent {

}
		3. import the component in app.module.ts and add it it to the combent declarations;

I solved this issue by using this command inside my project directory:
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67433893/unable-to-resolve-dependency-tree-error-for-creating-new-angular-project

		and tried this first
		npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular --force
		npm audit fix --force
		then I ran my project using "ng serve"

Creating and Communicating Between Angular Components

	Root application component is loaded first
		I have a matching route and display that route

	At the root is your app file which then loads the base route, that route loads the templates which are components and each of those may 
	have their own templates and routes in a tree structure on a single page

	Angular Modules can help make sense of this but don't confuse with nodejs modules
		containers that group all of these route/component trees and corresponding codes

	Component, Service, Directive, Pipe you register it in the Angular Module they are now only available in a module.
		You must register all of these except services in each model you want them.
		Services (providers) are injected in the root injector 

	Note setup was a bit crazy but we ended up updating the package and lock json files from github repository

Exploring the Angular Template Syntax
	For naming in styles consider:

		Name Spacing Standards like:
			BEM: https://getbem.com/introduction
			SMACSS: https://smacss.com

			If you find yourself stumbling with local or other styles look into deep selector

	Interpolation and Property Binding

		Double Curly Brace => Interpolation
			Interpolation is used when you just need to display that data
		Square Brackets => Property Binding
			Property Binding is used when you want to bond it to the property of a DOM element
		Parenthesis => Event Binding

		Expression Restrictions:
			Cannot use assignment operators: =,  +=, ++, etc)
			Cannot use new Keyword
			Expression Chaining with ;
			Can't access Global Namespace (like console, window, etc);

		Recommendations
			Should have No Side-Effects
			Fast
			Simple
			Idempotent - each time it should return the same result

	Event Bindings and Statements
		s
		Event Binding Restrictions for Statements
			Cannot use assignment operators: except =  ( +=, ++, etc)
			Cannot use new Keyword			
			Can't access Global Namespace (like console, window, etc);

		Recommendations
			Can have No Side-Effects
			No guarantee on Speed
			Simple
			Does not have to be idempotent
			
	Repeating Data with ngFor

		* before ngFor indicates its a structural directive  it will add an html item for each item in the array

		* let event of events creates a variable event as you loop through it.  nice!

	Handling Null valus with the Safe-Navigation Operator

	Hiding and showing Content with nglf

	Hiding content with the [Hidden] Binding

	Hiding and Showing Content ngSwitch

	Styling Components with ngClass

	Styling Components with ngStyle
